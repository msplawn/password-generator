# **Usage**
When users click Generate Password button they will be asked to choose a character length for their password. They will then be asked to choose various character types to include in the password including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The app will then generate a random password based on the user's chosen parameters. Users can then click the Copy to Clipboard button to copy the generated password.
